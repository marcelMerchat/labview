Labview

This LabVIEW file implements a Wattmeter using a basic NI USB-6001
voltage sensor.

LabVIEW programs are written with graphical tools instead of
more typical text programs such as JavaScript or Python. 
LabVIEW programs are drawn like flow charts or diagrams and
look something like an electric circuit diagram before being
compiled to execute on a computer.

While LabVIEW can perform abstract programming tasks, it is
most suitable for controlling laboratory equipment and taking
measurements. Anything that can be performed manually with
instruments can usually be accomplished automatically using LabVIEW.
